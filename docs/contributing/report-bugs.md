# Report Bugs

Thank you for taking the time to help improve Faker!
Your contributions are invaluable in keeping the project reliable and useful for everyone.
We kindly ask that you follow the guidelines below when reporting a bug.
Providing clear and detailed information allows us to verify problems quickly and work toward effective solutions.

If you believe you've discovered a bug in Faker, please submit a new issue using the [Bug Report Template](https://github.com/faker-js/faker/issues/new?labels=s%3A+pending+triage%2Cc%3A+bug&template=bug_report.yml).
This will help you provide clear reproduction steps and allow other users to verify that the issue is indeed a bug.

To facilitate a swift resolution, please include as much relevant detail as possible.
Providing comprehensive information upfront reduces the need for follow-up questions, enabling us to focus on resolving the issue efficiently.

::: info Note
If you have a general question that doesn't require a change to Faker - such as understanding how something works or learning how to contribute - please start a [discussion](https://github.com/faker-js/faker/discussions) or join our [Discord server](https://chat.fakerjs.dev) instead of opening an issue.
